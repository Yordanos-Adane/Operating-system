System call:chroot(): Changes the apparent root directory for the current running process and its children
chroot allows you to specify a different directory that the process will perceive as a root 
Once the chroot is called the process will be restricted to accessing files and directories with in the new root directory. it can not access files or directories outside of it.
Chroot is often used in security to isolate potentially vulnerable process. we can also create a controlled environment for testing software.
